The Company has built in place [“The SoFi philosophy”](https://www.sofi.com/how-it-works/)

Four Principals

•	Attack debt with a Plan.

•	Always have a safety net.

•	Put your money to work

•	Save for retirement and other Goals

The Finance Company goal is to help individuals with their money, whose products provide tools needed to take control of their financial futures with exclusive member benefits at not cost.


The company makes money through securitization, referral fees, interest earned on cash, sweep programs, whole loan sales and a lot more. The buyers in the securitization are institutions as well as other asset managers who buy premium upfront for the potential cash flows from the loan. 

This move enables them access to funds at a very competitive rate, on par with large commercial banks with big balance sheet. SoFi can make money through this because investors trust the quality of their loans.

Their total funding from 2018-2021

•	Revenue $547 Million (2018)

•	Net Income $126 Million (2018)

•	Total Asset $7.653 Billion [2021](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance/company_financials)

According to  [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance/company_financials) Sofi has raised a total of $3B in funding over 19 rounds. Their latest funding was on Jan 7th 2021 from a venture. The company is funded by 42 investors. ASAS capital, bracket Capital, RPM Ventures, SoftBank, GGV Capital, Manhattan Venture Partners, the Qatar Investment Company and many more.

Investors like pension and insurance funds, as well as other asset managers. They are willing to pay a premium above the principal value of the loan upfront for the future potential cash-flows.

SoFi has been accused of misleading its borrowers of how much they would save on their loan financing in a recent settlement with Federal Trade commission.  They made false statement about refinancing savings in television, print and Internet advertisements also boasted of $20,000.00 on average but ghe company excluded in it’s calculation student loan borrowers refinancing resulted in longer and sometimes more expensive, repayment timeline than they held prior. If SoFi violates the terms of the settlement, it could face civil penalties and the FTC will notify other lenders making similar savings claims of its action against SoFi according to CNBCA spokesperson from SoFi stated “We have always been committed to giving our current and prospective members clear and complete information with which to make smart financial choices, and are pleased to have this matter resolved,” the spokesperson wrote in an email”SoFi has been accused of misleading its borrowers of how much they would save on their loan financing in a recent settlement with Federal Trade commission.

[SoFi intended target are the educated, Affluent & Digital-Frist Millennial](https://thefinancialbrand.com/65922/sofi-digital-banking-fintech-competition/).It offers products and services at competitive rates to members because they pride themselves at efficiency. SoFi has lower costs from doing business online so they apply savings to their customers in form of high interest paid on deposits and don’t charge extra account fees on top.
SoFi [Technology](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-technologies-reports-second-quarter-2021-results/) Platform segment consists primarily of Galileo Financial Technologies, a technology provider they acquired in May 2020. Galileo has doubled its number of accounts to nearly 79 million from 36 million, through growth in both new and existing clients. SoFi has used the first year since acquisition to position the business for future growth, investing heavily to move operations from an on premises environment to the cloud, nearly double its headcount and expand to new geographies. It has caused a significant increase in expense and slower growth in contribution profit.Acquiring new acquisitions, expanding their wealth management. Innovating new Low cost trading.
    
[Affirm & After-Pay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp)- Cut credit cards companies out by offering shoppers a short term- monthly loan with no interest loans for purchases with no credit check.
Greensky- They link home improvement borrowers with banks by heloing consumers avoid entrenched lenders & save on interest be offering zero interest promotional periods.
There is a lot more Fintech companies that offer different services and make it easier for consumer. Fintech answers question about FicoScore.

SoFi is going to revolutionize personal banking & finance plus a digital platform that can basically do everything. The company would end up being the biggest FinTech disruptor because it has the potential to change personal finance/banking for the future and millennial generations.
[Most FinTech company uses Acquisition metrics which shows how many new customers they are managing onboard.](https://www.benzinga.com/fintech/19/06/13911172/fintech-analytics-the-top-7-metrics-every-fintech-company-should-monitor) 
Activation Metrics- How the companies are doing to getting people to use their products. Useful KPI’s include monthly Active Users and app/site traffic.
There are many other metrics used to emasure such as Revenues, Retention, Referrals and Marketing Metrics. All these metrics help to view the performance and data of how the company is doing
With the metric tools sofi was able to measure their members increase all the time in Q3 they added 377,00 people. They closed Q3 2021 with 2.937 million users, a 90% increase. In 2021 SoFi has a membership growth rate of 106.33%, as they have added.
SoFi is experiencing growth on all aspects. Hoping to be the next big thing in the years to come, helping to create financial wealth. SoFi has built a better banking app than any other company including offering a 4.27 million financial service products to their members. Members are offered 1.03 million lending products and 3.24 million financial services products to help members improve their future.

My advice to the company would be to continue to financé loan and create wealth for millennials. They should stop charging a high percentage on their interest. Their investment has a lot of beenifts frothei members. SoFi should also reduce their APR percentage on student loans.Instead of having a robo advisors, members would prefer speaking to a Live person that can quickly solve their problems. It would benefit the company because the millennial generation would get less student loan debt and able to pay off their loans as quickly as possible.This can also put modern banking & Loan companies out of business.  Instead of charging high percentage on loans & high interest. This can help SoFi increase their revenue and be one of the top Fintech company with the best loand and wealth management company.  It would bring us into a new age of crypto and bitcoin, where payment is made digitally.
